SQL database

 Introduction:
This dataset was gotten from fp20analytics.com monthly Analytics challenges(November 2023 version)

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly platform that enables the collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of crime-related datasets. By employing Python's versatile tools and techniques, the project aims to provide a systematic approach to understand patterns, trends, and correlations within crime data. The platform will facilitate the identification of high-risk areas, crime hotspots, temporal patterns, and modus operandi, thereby aiding in the formulation of targeted intervention strategies for crime prevention and law enforcement optimization.

Stakeholders expectations:
- The TACTICAL CRIME Analysis project aims to provide insights that can inform the development and implementation of effective crime prevention policies and the desire for data-driven recommendations on allocating resources to areas most in need based on crime analysis
- By leveraging the  datasets, advanced statistical and analytical tools to identify patterns, correlations, and trends within crime data, stakeholders can expect for a system that promotes transparency in crime data analysis, aiding in informed decision-making
